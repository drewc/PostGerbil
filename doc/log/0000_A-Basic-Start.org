How the path name in file links should be stored.

Valid values are:

- relative ::  Relative to the current directory, i.e. the directory of the file
  into which the link is being inserted.

- absolute ::  Absolute path, if possible with ~ for home directory.

- noabbrev ::  Absolute path, no abbreviation of home directory.

- adaptive ::  Use relative path for files in the current directory and
  sub-directories of it. For other files, use an absolute path.
